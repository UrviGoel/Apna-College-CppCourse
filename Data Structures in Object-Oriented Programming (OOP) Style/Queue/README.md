# Implementation of Queue Data Structure in Object-Oriented Programming Style using C++

This directory contains the C++ source code for two popular object-oriented implementations of a queue. The implementations utilize linked lists and arrays, respectively, to provide efficient queue functionality. The repository includes the following files:

1. `arrayImplementation.cpp`: This file contains the implementation of a queue using an array. It demonstrates how to create and manipulate a queue data structure using array-based operations.
2. `linkedListImplementation.cpp`: This file contains the implementation of a queue using a linked list. It showcases how to create and manipulate a queue data structure using linked list-based operations.

Each implementation follows an object-oriented programming style, allowing for modularity, encapsulation, and code reusability. The files provide a comprehensive understanding of how queues can be implemented in C++ using different underlying data structures.
