# Binary Search Tree Data Structure in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Style using C++

This directory contains an object-oriented implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) using C++. The implementation follows the principles of Object-Oriented Programming to provide a modular and efficient approach to working with BSTs. The repository includes the following files:

1. `implementBST.cpp`: This file contains the implementation of the BST data structure using an object-oriented approach.
2. `checkBSTorNOT.cpp`: This program is designed to check whether a given tree is a valid Binary Search Tree (BST) or not.
3. `findHeight.cpp`: This code snippet helps to find the height of a BST, which represents the maximum number of edges in any path from the root to a leaf node.
4. `findMinMaxFromBST.cpp`: This code snippet is used to find the minimum and maximum values from a BST efficiently.
5. `treeTraversal.cpp`: This program demonstrates various types of tree traversal techniques, including level order traversal, preorder traversal, postorder traversal, and inorder traversal.
