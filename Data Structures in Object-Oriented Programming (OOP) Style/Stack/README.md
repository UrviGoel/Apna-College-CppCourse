# Stack Data Structure in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Style using C++
This directory provides C++ source code for two object-oriented stack implementations using linked lists and arrays. It also offers C++ solutions for well-known problems that rely on the stack data structure. The repository includes the following files:

1. `arrayImplementation.cpp`: This file contains the implementation of a stack using an array. It demonstrates how to create and manipulate a stack data structure using array-based operations.
2. `linkedListImplementation.cpp`: This file contains the implementation of a stack using a linked list. It showcases how to create and manipulate a stack data structure using linked list-based operations.
3. `checkBalancedParentheses.cpp`: This code checks if parentheses are balanced in an expression or not.
4. `evaluatePostfix.cpp`: This code evaluates a postfix expression.
5. `evaluatePrefix.cpp`: This code evaluates a prefix expression.
6. `infixToPostfix.cpp`: This code converts an infix expression to a postfix expression.
