# Implementations of linked list data structure in OOP style using C++

This directory contains `object-oriented` implementations of various linked list types using `C++`. The linked list variations included are:

- `Singly Linked List`: An implementation of a singly linked list, where each node points to the next node in the list.
- `Singly Circular Linked List`: An implementation of a singly linked list where the last node points back to the first node, creating a circular structure.
- `Doubly Linked List`: An implementation of a doubly linked list, where each node has pointers to both the previous and next nodes.
